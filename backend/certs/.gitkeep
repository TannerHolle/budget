# Teller.io TLS Certificates
# 
# Place your Teller.io client certificate and private key files here.
# Teller provides these files when you sign up (usually in a teller.zip file):
# - certificate.pem (or cert.pem)
# - private_key.pem (or key.pem)
#
# These files are excluded from git for security.
# Download them from your Teller.io dashboard.
#
# In your .env file, set:
# TELLER_CERT_PATH=./certs/certificate.pem
# TELLER_KEY_PATH=./certs/private_key.pem
